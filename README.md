# expense-tracker
This is a Full Stack Expense Tracker Application. For reference, I want to thank Maclinz from the Code Dealer on Youtube for this idea, as this is one of my beginner projects and I learnt a lot from him and this project. 

As for the project: The backend uses Node.js and Express, which connect it to a MongoDB database, while the front-end uses ReactJs to create a interactive user interface. This application is responsive, and while it its not too advanced, it showcases the use of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.js)

All code is public, meaning anyone viewing this is free to use it however they like :)
